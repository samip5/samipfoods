# Samip's Food Mod | This repo has been archived.

This mod has been successfully upgraded to Minecraft version 1.11.2 and it was created originally for a school project.

I'm thankful of the support I have recieved from the other developers in the MMD (Minecraft Mod Develoment) server in Discord.
I'll also thank Zaweri for helping with the mod where he could as I were sometimes making typos. :smile:

Credits of some of the textures go to Zaweri and Pam's HarvestCraft including it's authors.
